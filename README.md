# Knapsack in P5 JS

This is an implementation of Knapsack problem, in p5 js. With a refresh, every time the knapsack is loaded with random capacity (being shown on-screen), and the final output being shown as well (optimal cost). 

Also note that this is the most optimized solution only, feasible solutions have not been shown. (Optimized Solution - Profit per unit weight method).
